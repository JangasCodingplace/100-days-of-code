# 100DaysOfCode Diary

## Day 2 - K-Fold Cross-validation
- I discussed the concept of K-Fold Cross validation
- I've provided some kind of demosnippets with
    - basic KFold Cross Validation
    - KFold Cross Validation for various sizes
    - KFold Cross Validation to train an nlp


## Day 1 - Tokenization with NLTK
- I discussed the concept of tokenization in natural language processing (NLP), which is the process of splitting a string of text into individual tokens (words and punctuation marks).
- I've provided an example of a tokenization script in Python that uses regular expressions to split the input text into a list of tokens. I've also discussed how NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) provides a number of built-in functions for tokenizing text.
- I showed how to add a docstring in numpy style to the tokenize function, and provided some test cases that can be used to test the function's behavior.
- wrote some unit tests
