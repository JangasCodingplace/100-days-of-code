# 100DaysOfCode Diary

## Day 11 - Simple Christmas Tree
- print a Christmas Tree in Python

## Day 10 - Simple Image Resize
- Another lazy day before christmas: just another quickwin - a resize image function in Python

## Day 9 - MMOCR Kie Prediction
- Quick and dirty: high level walk through MMOCR Kie Prediction. Nice one!

## Day 8 - Comparing Pytesseract and MMOCR
- described downsides of PyTesseract and some alternatives
- compared PyTesseract and MMOCR with images from day 3 and 5

## Day 7 - Building a simple Work time logger in Python
- init basic python script
- creating a simple script which is able to log work time
- write work time into log files
- split logs by date and split logs by project

## Day 6 - Build a Raw Typescript and React Frontend for image labeling
- init a basic react typescript project without additional UI tools (e.g. MUI)
- make usage of a canvas
- draw rectangles in that canvas
- create a form
- style the page with some css

## Day 5 - OpenCV Contour Detection & Morphological Closing
- using the GrabCut algorithm is a computer vision algorithm that can be used to segment an image into foreground and background regions
- basic image processing operations, such as color conversion, blurring, edge detection, and dilation, can be performed using functions from the OpenCV library
- find and draw contours on an image with OpenCV

## Day 4 - Edge and Corner Detection
- Convert the image to grayscale using the cv2.cvtColor function and the cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY flag, if necessary.
- Use the cv2.Canny function to detect edges in the image, if desired.
- Use the cv2.cornerHarris function to detect corners in the image, or use one of the other corner detection algorithms available in OpenCV

## Day 3 - PyTesseract OCR
I provided information and examples of code that can be used to:

- Use Pytesseract to extract text from images.
- Preprocess images to improve the accuracy of OCR.
- Rotate images around a given angle using OpenCV or Pillow.


## Day 2 - K-Fold Cross-validation
- I discussed the concept of K-Fold Cross validation
- I've provided some kind of demosnippets with
    - basic KFold Cross Validation
    - KFold Cross Validation for various sizes
    - KFold Cross Validation to train an nlp


## Day 1 - Tokenization with NLTK
- I discussed the concept of tokenization in natural language processing (NLP), which is the process of splitting a string of text into individual tokens (words and punctuation marks).
- I've provided an example of a tokenization script in Python that uses regular expressions to split the input text into a list of tokens. I've also discussed how NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) provides a number of built-in functions for tokenizing text.
- I showed how to add a docstring in numpy style to the tokenize function, and provided some test cases that can be used to test the function's behavior.
- wrote some unit tests
